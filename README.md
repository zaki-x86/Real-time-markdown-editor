# Real-time Markdown Editor

Markdown is a popular text format written in an easy-to-read way and is convertible to HTML. It is a markup format that has been popularized by sites such as GitHub and Stack Overflow.

This app will allow you to write markdown text on the left side of the screen and the corresponding HTML will be rendered on the right side. It will also allow multiple people to work on the same markdown document at the same time via a sharable URL and all changed will be saved.
